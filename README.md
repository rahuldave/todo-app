# Prompt

I would like to create a simple todo app using Next.js on the front end and node.js and express on the back end. I am completely new to javascript development so you will have to tell me how to set my environment up. This app should present a textbox where i can type in my todo. Once I hit submit, that todo should be added to a sqlite database table at the backend. The user interface should show todo's with the time and day of their addition, latest todo first. This list of todos should come below our textarea and submit button

I'd be happy to guide you through creating a simple todo app using Next.js, Node.js, Express, and SQLite. Since you're new to JavaScript development, I'll walk you through setting up your environment and creating the application step by step.
Let's start by setting up your development environment:
Install Node.js: First, you need to install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). Download and install it from https://nodejs.org/
Set up your project: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

Copy
mkdir todo-app
cd todo-app
npm init -y
This creates a new directory for your project and initializes a package.json file.
Install necessary dependencies: Run the following command to install the required packages:

Copy
npm install next react react-dom express sqlite3 axios
Now, let's create the basic structure of your application:

Todo App Project Structure
Click to open code
Now, let's create these files and implement the functionality:
Create the Next.js frontend:

Next.js Frontend (pages/index.js)
Click to open code
Create the TodoList component:

TodoList Component (components/TodoList.js)
Click to open code
Create the API route for todos:

API Route for Todos (pages/api/todos.js)
Click to open code
Create the Express server:

Express Server (server/server.js)
Click to open code
Set up the database:

Database Setup (server/database.js)
Click to open code
Create a Next.js configuration file:

Next.js Configuration (next.config.js)
Click to open code
Now that we have all the components in place, you can start your application:
Update your package.json scripts:
json

Copy
"scripts": {
  "dev": "node server/server.js",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server/server.js"
}
Run the development server:

Copy
npm run dev
Your todo app should now be running at http://localhost:3000. You can add new todos, and they will be stored in the SQLite database and displayed on the page.
This setup provides a basic todo app with a Next.js frontend and an Express backend using SQLite. You can expand on this by adding features like editing or deleting todos, marking them as complete, or adding user authentication.
Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail?

I am getting a strange error: TypeError: initDatabase is not a function even though initDatabase is clearly defined as a function in database.js. Can you help me?

I apologize for the confusion. The error you're encountering suggests that there might be an issue with how we're exporting and importing the initDatabase function. Let's review and modify the database.js file to ensure the function is properly exported.

Updated Database Setup (server/database.js)
Click to open code
Now, let's make sure the server.js file is correctly importing these functions:

Updated Express Server (server/server.js)
Click to open code
These changes should resolve the TypeError: initDatabase is not a function error. Here's what we did:
In database.js, we made sure to export both initDatabase and executeQuery functions using module.exports.
In server.js, we're now correctly importing the initDatabase function from the database.js file.
If you're still encountering issues, please check the following:
Make sure your file paths are correct. The database.js file should be in the same server directory as server.js.
Ensure you've saved all changes to both files.
Try stopping your server (if it's running) and restart it with npm run dev.
If you're using an IDE or code editor with caching, try closing and reopening the project.
Make sure there are no typos in the file names or function names.
If you're still experiencing issues after making these changes, please provide any new error messages or unexpected behavior you're seeing, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot further.
